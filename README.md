# The Ruined Tower
The Ruined Tower is a 2D platformer where the player is trying to reach the top of the tower, rumored to reach the land of the Gods and give everlasting glory to anyone who can reach the top, but no one has survived the climb yet. This game will incorporate difficult physics that may change between areas of the tower to create a hard and entertaining game, with multiple tower variations to increase or decrease difficulty to the player's liking. Will you be able to reach the top of the ruined tower?
